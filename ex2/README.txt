Hey there! Welcome to my solution for Exercise 2


In the "plots" directory you will find 

1. examples of runs plots of the methods we have worked with against the original function:
    
    hermite_example.jpg
    least_squares_example.jpg
    pw_linear_example.jpg
    lagrange_interp_example.jpg

    these plots show that the algorithms work!


2. plots for the error comparison with or without noise, such as:
    
    noisy_compare_max_error_func_1.jpg
    compare_max_error_func_1.jpg
    
    note: function indexes correspond to the indexes in the HW instructions. In any case the functions are written in the plots.

3. Image restoration files:

    image_restoration_1_to_10.jpg
    image_restoration_1_to_3.jpg
    polynomial_fix.jpg

    the code for the polynomial fix is:
    ImageInterpolationFix.m

    The idea was mitigating the harsh effects of the polynomial in the edges by performing a sort of piece-wise polynomial extrapolation.
